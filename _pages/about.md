I am currently a graduate student at [School of Astronautics](http://sa.hit.edu.cn/), Harbin Institute of Technology. Before that, I received my B.Eng. degree from [Harbin Engineering University](http://www.hrbeu.edu.cn/) in 2019.
My research interests include computer vision and deep learning. I focus on the research of object detection in recent years and I have done several projects using both traditional methods and deep learning. 
At present, I want to apply for a PhD position to further my study. In addition, I am also glad to do other computer vision research.
